# naive_sentence_generator

In this repository we have explored the statistical approach to language modeling using n-grams language models.

The program instantiates 2 language models, one unigram  model and one bigram model, both using Laplace smoothing. With each model, the following tasks are performed:

1. Display 50 generated sentences from this model using Shannonâ€™s method.
2. Score the probabilities of the provided test sentences and display the average and standard deviance of these sentences.
